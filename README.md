# Supervised-learning
The first problem is a regression task. The aim is to train a neural network to approx-
imate an unknown function: f in which training points are afflicted by some
noise:
 y = f(x) + noise
I decided to study different type of optimizers, loss functions and activation functions in
order to be able to understand what are the ones that fits better in this type of problem.
Due to the small dimension of the training dataset, hyperparameters are tuned using a
grid search, I also use a k-fold cross-validation strategy.
